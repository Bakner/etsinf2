Exercise 4

time ./SeqAdd

Total addition is: 20000000

real    0m0.663s
user    0m0.632s
sys     0m0.028s

time ./ThAdd

Total addition is: 20000000

real    0m0.229s
user    0m0.664s
sys     0m0.012s


SeqAdd has no concurrent execution, each row computes its sum in order. With ThAdd, each sum is computed in a different thread, concurrently. The final sum is computed in a similar way in the main thread.
