$ ls -l /proc/self

/proc/self is a softlink to the current process, which is why the PID to which is linked varies if the command is executed multiple times

$ head -1 /proc/self/maps
$ cat /proc/self/maps | head -1

The command which accesses to /proc/self is either head or cat, so that the first line of information, which includes the executable file for that command changes from /usr/bin/head to /bin/cat
