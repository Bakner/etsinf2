Exercise 1

$a0 * 36 written in $v0 using shifts and sums

sll $t0,$a0,5
sll $t1,$a0,2
add $v0,$t0,$t1

Code implemented in reloj1.s

26 clock cycles with sll
55 clock cycles without sll




Exercise 2

$a0 * 31 written in $v0 using shifts, sums and substractions

sll $t0,$a0,5
sub $v0,$t0,$a0

Code implemented in reloj2.s

Speed comparison

19 clock cycles with sll
55 clock cycles without sll
