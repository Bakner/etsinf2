Exercise 1
	M++ to memory -> option d

Question pool

1) lw $t0, var
	0x1000 > li $t0, 0x1000
	0x00100000 > lui $t0, 0x10
	0x101000 > lui $t0, 0x10
			   ori $t0, 0x1000

2) *A: 0x10000000
	The first approach may load twice the address for A. The second approach only loads it once for both instructions.

3) lb > 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xd6
   lbu> 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xd6
   lbu should be used

4) $ra points to jal InputS, therefore an infinite loop is created
