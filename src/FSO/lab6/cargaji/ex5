Event-based was faster.

On instances with many CPUs, waiting could be faster than events as you would not waste time suspending and re-starting the thread could waste time while running a loop on a CPU could be faster.

On instances with a single CPU, event based would be faster as the thread would be dropped to suspension and another thread could take its place.
