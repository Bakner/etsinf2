Read descriptor.c descriptor = 3 
Write descriptor.c descriptor=4 

Analyze the code and the result of the execution and answer the following.

1-. What variables correspond to the file descriptors in the proposed code?

0 -> stdin
1 -> stdout
2 -> stderr
3 -> fopen(fda)
4 -> fopen(fdb)

2-. Explain the number assigned by the system to the variable fd{a,b}

It is the next free available file descriptor number, as 0-2 are taken by standard streams.
fda is given 3 as it is the first open()'d file and fdb is given 4 as it is the next one.
